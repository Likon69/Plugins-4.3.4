## This version I found in the comments on the official forum. It was made for MoP. 
###### I modify it so that the API correspond to that of cataclysm.

If you try to compile with Honorbuddy. You would have this error.

*File:  Line: 0 Error: The call is ambiguous between the following methods or properties: 'Jumpy.Extensions.CustomFormat(System.TimeSpan)' and 'Jumpy.Extensions.CustomFormat(System.TimeSpan)'

I don't know where it comes from. This error is also in version 1.5. So I think it's a general problem of this plugin.
Don't compile the plugin with hb.
